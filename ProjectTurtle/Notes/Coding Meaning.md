# Projects-Python
 This document is to give examples of what parts of the code does, and how it runs.
 This is for those starting out with programming or who just need a reminder.

# "from turtle import *"
 This imports everything from 'turtle' this is done using '*'.

 # "color('Red')"
 This is used to set the colour for what you are drawing.
 This can use standard 'RED' or others like HEX to make a colour.

 # "forward(100)"
 This is to give a direction to our 'turtle' inside the brackets goes the distance in pixels.

 # "backward(100)"
 This is litterly just a reverse direction you can get the same result using forward with a '-' infront of the given number.

 # "Right(90)" & "Left(90)"
 This is simple it rotates our turtle left or right by 90 degrees.

# "circle(100)"
Makes a circle to the set radius given inside the brackets

# "Begin_fill()"
This is the opening so that the code know the set object made will be filled though will now fill untill completed, see bellow.

# "End_fill()"
This lets the program know that you are done with this object and that it is ready to be filled.

# "penup()"
Lifts pen so that it will not draw when in movement.

# "pendown()"
Puts pen back down so that it is able to draw.
